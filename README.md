# Prediction-of-Click-on-Ad

In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

This data set contains the following features:

* 'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes
* 'Age': cutomer age in years
* 'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
* 'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet
* 'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement
* 'City': City of consumer
* 'Male': Whether or not consumer was male
* 'Country': Country of consumer
* 'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window
* 'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad

After doing EDA I train `Logestic Regression` model and test it. Details are below:
